### Implementation of: 
# PNGme: An Intermediate Rust Project

This repository contains an implementation - with some personal flavour and ideas - of the [**PNGme: An Intermediate Rust Project**](https://jrdngr.github.io/pngme_book/) Book, freely available and generously left for free use and abuse to new and intermediate Rustaceans by [**Jordan**](https://github.com/jrdngr). Cheers, mate!

Basic functionality is implemented; 
##### Potential next steps

- [ ] Introduce CLI options to handle multiple separate message chunks (Decode / Remove)
- [ ] Add Functionality for Editing existing messages

- [ ] Add support for URL inputs and downloading images from the internet
- [ ] Add support for other file types (i.e. [Chunk-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Chunk-based_formats) file formats)
- [ ] Add an option to encrypt or obfuscate your hidden messages
- [ ] Figure out a way to automatically detect potential messages hidden in a (PNG) file
