# PNGme: An Intermediate Rust Project

This repository contains an implementation - with some personal flavour and ideas - of the [**PNGme: An Intermediate Rust Project**](https://jrdngr.github.io/pngme_book/) Book, freely available and generously left for free use and abuse to new and intermediate Rustaceans by [**Jordan**](https://github.com/jrdngr). Cheers, mate!
